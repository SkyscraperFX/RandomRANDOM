# RandomRANDOM
Visual Basic 6 application example which randomizes uppercase alpha-characters and creates a randomized 6 character string in a loop until RANDOM is spelled, logging attempts which have the correct characters---though the order may be wrong--- in a list box as it runs counting loops to see how many it takes to "randomly spell RANDOM".
