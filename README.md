# RandomRANDOM
Visual Basic 6 application example which randomizes uppercase alpha-characters and creates a randomized 6 character string from a timer until RANDOM is spelled, counting and logging [unique] attempts which have the correct characters---though the order is wrong--- in a list box as it runs counting loops to see how many it takes to "randomly spell RANDOM". When RANDOM is finally generated the total loops is logged with the RANDOM string as the prgram proceeds to try it again.

PS
In my experiments it usually takes over 20,000 loops to finally spell random if my memory serves me right.
